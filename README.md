- Do NOT commit code with errors(Doing this makes no sense)
- Do NOT EVER commit without testing(this just causes problems for everyone)
- YOU mess up textures you get to re-do all the JSON files(They take a very long time to fix)
- NO structure changes without consulting other team members or at least explain how you are changing it(Just so every knows what going on)
- NO adding libraries or APIs without consulting other team members
- If you have to push a commit with a problem YOU CANT FIX make a issue for it immediately
